  and the National Center for Education Statistics, which detailed information 
  on education in different states including number of students enrolled in 
  certain grades, the revenue and expenditure of states, average testing scores
  and demographic data. We found this dataset to be particularly helpful in 
  answering our questions on how race and state spendings on education impact
  student achievement as they contain demographic and performance statistics."),

  race and academic performance."),

  score highest regardless of test subject and grade level. Blacks/African
  Americans scored the lowest. While we acknowledge that race is not the only 
  factor that can affect this performance, the disparities between races are
  clear."),

  scores did not find much correlation between these two variables. States with
  a higher average amount spent per student did not match with higher scores 
  almost anywhere in America."), 
  p("Through our stacked bar chart displaying the distribution of race across 
  educational programs, over 50% of the AP (Advanced Placement) and Gifted and
  Talented programs are consisted of white students, which is disproportionately
  high compared to total enrollment numbers. All other race groups except 
  Asians and two or more races display the opposite, with enrollment in all
  advanced education programs lower than total enrollment. To us, this suggests
  boundaries to advanced education are not equal."),
  p("Our major takeaways include believing that spendings are not the biggest
  factors in creating a successful academic environment. Something else we
  found especially highlighted was the uneven distribution of races across
  educational programs, likely a major contributor to the outcome of average
  standardized test scores. National average scores also detail obvious 
  differences. Overall, we feel that while money is not a key factor in student
  success, the barriers faced by students of different backgrounds is something
  America has yet to equalize.")
