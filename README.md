Project Proposal

**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

In the midst of the Black Lives Matters movement, racial injustice, and racial bias have been illuminated from the ongoing protests. Thus, we decided to utilize this opportunity to choose a topic both of interest and relevancy.
Specifically, we are interested in the equity of education in the U.S. We want to figure out how variables such as race, income level, and geographical location affect the quality of education and the salaries after education.

[This paper](https://www.aacu.org/sites/default/files/StepUpLeadEquity.pdf) uses data visualizations to show inequities in students and schools.

[This paper](https://www.oecd.org/education/school/50293148.pdf) discusses equity and quality of education and uses data to show that they go hand in hand.

[This interactive data](http://www.schoolfundingfairness.org/is-school-funding-fair/interactive-data) shows school funding fairness (or unfairness).

**What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**
- How does the income of parents affect the performance of students?
- How does the income level going into college compare to the salary of college graduates?
- How do various factors of a college education impact the salaries of students following graduation?
- How does race affect educational achievement?
- What affects graduation rates in high school?

**Datasets:**

[This dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project) is from Kaggle. Data was collected from the US Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics, so it was collected by government organizations in the US. This dataset has information on education in different states including number of students enrolled in certain grades, the revenue and expenditure of states, average testing scores and demographic data. There are 1716 observations in this dataset, and there are 25 features in states_all. There are 266 features in states_all_extended, which contains more demographic data. This dataset can help answer our question about how race affects educational achievement because it has demographic and performance data.


[This dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries ) was found on Kaggle, and all data was acquired by the Wall Street Journal based on data from Payscale, Inc. The data talks about the differences in salaries based upon types of colleges attended, region of college, as well as the majors students selected during their time of study. In the dataset concerning salary based on degrees, there are 8 columns and 50 rows. Within the salaries by college type dataset, there are 8 columns and 249 rows. Looking at the salaries by region set of data, we notice 8 columns and 320 column values. With the information above, we are now able to further examine the question of how characteristics of a college education affect income after graduation.


[This data](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/data.html) was found on the U.S. Department of Education’s website. The data was collected through the Civil Rights Data Collection by the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights. The data in this collection is self-reported by public schools and public school districts, relying on the schools’ and districts’ own data collection. Typically, this data will be collected by school administrators and enrollment offices. There are approximately 100,000 observations across this data set representing each school and district that reported to the CRDC. There are 216 features reported in this data set. This data will provide a comprehensive report of school and school district characteristics, discipline, offenses, harassment and bullying, restraint and seclusion, single-sex interscholastic athletics, early childhood education, pathways to college and career, school finance, and teachers and other personnel of schools and districts located in the U.S. Many of the questions above can be directly or indirectly answered using this data set.
